* Continuing Feldspars<2016-02-23 Tue>


includes 
- granites
- rhylites
* Techtosilicates
- You can get KSpar in metamorphic rocks, but that's more specialized
  + Potassium Feldspar, not as abundant as plagioclase, but still extremely abundant and common mineral.
  + Kind of like quartz.
  + In general, you need silica-rich Environments, \ce{KAlSi3}, that's a lot of silica.
  + A felsic rock. Compositionally, we need that felisc composition to get Feldspar
  + very high temperature
  + these things are called granualites
  + metamorphic fomration
  + IN addition to the formula we just covered, often times in KSpar, we can have Fe^{3+} subbing in.
    * It would substitute for Aluminum. 1-for-1
    * when we get this sub in KSpar, it gives it a pink color.
    * most Kspars are a little pink/orange (not found in Plagioclase)
    * Another substitution is Lead - gives a green Amazonite
- All feldspars are very common in sedementary rocks
  + only thing more common is quartz.
  + quartz is just more resistent to weathering
- An Arcose Sandstone
  + A feldspar-rich sandstone. Fairly immature
- Pegmatite
  + All examples we saw in lab with beautiful crystals, those are from pegmatites
  + very water rich environment
- Plagioclase Feldspar
  + its everywhere, ther isn't a rock type you can't get plagioclase from
  + igneous, hydrothermal, .. it's everywhere
  + In more felisc rocks, things tend to be more sodium rich or Albite rich
    * so granite or rhylite. Plagioclase there will be more albite
  + In more mafic rocks, more sodium rich
    * basalt, gavrow, anorthite rich
    * Also generally correspond to tempratures
    * Boen's reaction series (higher T - Mafic, lower T Sodium rich, felsic)
    * Know the Feldspar Triangle
- Techtosilicates
**  Zeolite Group
  + in terms of variety and # of minerals. The zeolites contain the most different mineral varities of any silicate
  + 80 naturally occuring zeolites, more synth'd in a lab
  + All zeolites contain structural water. H2O
  + Two ways water can be held in minerals
    * Structural water:
      - Molecules of water that live inside the structure
    * Others have OH in their chemistry and get another H when disturbed.
    * Formula: M_{x} D_{y} Al. Formula page 1.
    * The ratio of Aluminum to Silica depends on the M-side. They tend to be mono-valent cations
    * D tends to be di-valent cations (Ca, Mn)
    * Structure itself: silicon tetrahedra with long, wide-open tunnels or holes where the water gets in.
  + (Na, Ca, H2O) are loosly bound and exchangable in the structure.
    - these make it absorbant
    - Dessecant
    - Na+ -><- Ca^{2+}
  + Mineral Use:
    - 
  + Common Zeolites: (not that important, recognize them as zeolites)
    * Amalcine (Na) Isometric (looks like Leucite, but different size and shape)
    * Chabazite (Ca, Na, u) Triclinic (mixed sort of mineral, triclinic. Looks hexagonal (pseudohexagonal))
    * Heulandite (Na, Ca) Monoclinic 
    * Stillbite (Na, Ca) Monoclinic (elongaded, blady sheets)
    * Naturolite (Na) Orthorhombic (radiating fibres)
  + Where do zeolites form?
    - Environment is Low-Low Temperature Metamorphism.
    - Hydrothermal Alteration
    - common rocks with a lot of K, Na, Ca (like in feldspar)
    - *Low Temp Alteration & metamorphism, often in mafic rocks*
    - Mafic rocks are very susceptable to low T, hydrothermal alteration
    - They break down and make zeolites.
    - Often fine-grained fillings in cracks or voids, or vesicles.
    - Great place for Zeolites to form.
    - Difficult to identify these fine grains without going to XRD.


silica group
feldspar group
zeolite group
** Category (Sodalite, Leucite, Nephiline): Feldspathoids

- Like feldspar, but they exist in Low-Si rocks.
  + "Silica-Undersaturated environments"
  + Not enough Si to form Quartz
  + Still have Alkali Elements, those are necessary for Feldspathoids
  + Weird to have that kind of environment.


- Leucite: \ce{KAlSi2O6}
  + soccer ball-shaped, roundish crystals
  + Formula looks a lot like KSpar (KAl)
  + Why would we get Leucite instead of KSpar?
    * <write reaction>
    * <Look for Pics>
    * If we low silica rocks/highSilica Rocks
    * lookup (30:00):question:
- Nepheline <complicated formula>
  + Formula for Nepheline
  + Has a little sodium and calcium, not so pure in real world
  + One other Mineral End Membe: Nepheline has complete solid solution to
    + KAlSiO4 (Calcilite), the end of a solid solution.
- Bonus:
  + Two common igneous rock types. Silica undersaturated and have abundant nephaline
  + Phonalite (igneous rocks)
    - pings when you hit it, doesn't break either
    - Si-undersaturated
    - Alkali-enriched
    - Volcanic rock
  + Syenite (the intrusive rock)
    - silica undersaturated, intrusive rock
- Other Feldspathoids (foids):
  + Sodalite: Na8(AlSiO4)6 Cl2 (chlorine, otherwise it's albite)
  + Lazurite:
    * (Na,Ca)8 (AlSiO4)6 (SO4, Cl, S)2
    * Beautiful Azure Blue color
    * Primary constituant of Lapiz Lazuli
  + Petalite: Li(AlSi4O10)
    * society really likes Petalite for it's lithium. We <3 Lithium
    * Hard to find large quantities of Lithium
    * This can be found in Lithium-Rich Pegmatites
    * :question: why does Petalite buck-trends. why unusual?

** Scapolite (it's own little group)
- solid solution between two end members
  + (Marialite) Na4Al3Si9O24Cl
  + (Meionite) Ca4Al6Si6O24(CO3)
  + So, bring in Na, Ca
    * Except for the Cl and the CO3 (carbonate), these look like:
      - very common mineral things are identical to... Plagioclase Feldspars! Anorthite, Albite
    * Scapolite takes the place of Plagioclase Feldspars in a *contact-metamorphic environment*
    * Magma intrusions cause magma intrusions. (Silicate Magma's into a carbonate limestone)
    * CO2 will be burned off into the atmosphere
    * That's where Scapolite forms. It's an indicator of these conditions.
- Keep End-Members Of Solid Solution Paired
  + Mariolite, Myanite
  + (Feldspars): Albite, Anorthite
END OF TECHTOSILICATES
================================================================================

* Phyllosilicates
- Slightly less polymerizatoin of silica
- Construct Phyllosilicates
- There are fundamental structures of phyllosiliates
- *Know the Structure First*
- they're sheet silicates
- Phyllo dough, sheety. fun fact.
- Silicon tetrahedra shares 3 of its oxygens with other silicon tetrahedra. Leaving 1 to bond with other things
- Phyllosilicates are generally soft (1's and 2's) :important:
- Not very dense, fairly open structures () :important:
- Single plane of leavage, easy to identify cleavage :important:
** Structure
- Combination of Tetrahedral Sheets (T)
- and Octahedral Sheets (O)
- Tetrahedral Sheets:
  + Tetrahedral Sites, connected in 2-D Sheet
  + filled with either Al, or Si.
- Octahedral Sheets:
  + Made out of 2 adjacent planes of OH groups.
  + Between which, are a whole bunch of Octahedral, edge-sharing, sites.
- Between these two OH groups, we get our octahedral sites.
  + Filled with Cations
  + Depending on the Cations, there are 2 types of Octahedral Sheets
    * Tri-Octahedral Sheet:
      - 3/3 sites are filled with a 2+ cation (Mg, Fe)
    * Di-Octahedral Sheet:
      - 2 out of 3 sites are filled with 3+ Cation (Al)
      - in the other site, it's vacant
- These building blocks are important:
  1) Tetrahedral Sheets
  2) Tri-Octahedral Sheets
  3) Di-Octahedral Sheets
- Now we glue the different sheets together:
  + Combine T and/or O sheets to make Layers
  + Two Most Fundamental (T is trapezoid) (O is rectangle)
    - (T)(O) Layer
    - (T)(O)(T) Layer
    - (O)... sometimes...
  + Layers are bound together by VanDerWaals or Interlayer Cation

:question: about K end member in the table


Look at page 5 for the phengite information... Ask :question: about it.

* Phyllosilicates Continued <2016-02-25 Thu>
- Phyllosilicates cont.
- Phengite
  + similar to muscovite, but it takes the place of muscovite at High Pressures
  + \ce{K(Al2)(AlSi3)O10(OH)2} (Muscovite)
    * Add some Mg^{2+} and some Si for Al and creates Phengite
    * (4si/4Al) = (3/1)
    * Phengite is a really common indicator of ultra-high pressure/conditions
- Paragonite is muscovite except remove K and put in Na
** Quick Review and Finish Up
*** Micas
- TOT + interlayer Cations
- Biotite:
  + *2 end members (Fe^{2+} Anite), (Mg^{2+} Phlogopite)*
  + Common Brown Mica, can get it everywhere
  + Need a lil Mg and Fe and a Na
- Muscovite (one end member) :question:
  + Silvery/clear
  + restricted to felsic, igneous, metamorphic, and sedementary derivatives
- Paragonite:
  + Na-rich
  + Higher Pressure Mica
  + Paragonite, like Phengite, is an indicator of High Pressure
  + sometimes, paragonite is more white than muscovite's silvery whitish color
- Phengite:
  + Si-rich, high pressure
- Muscovite, Paragonite, Phengite can be called "White Mica"
- Glauconite:
  + green mica, because Fe^{3+}
  + Often fine grained in marine sedimentsf
END MICAS
----------------------------------------
** Other Phyllosilicates
- Chlorite:
  + Dark Green
  + low-temperature metamorphic rocks
  + hydrating mafic protoliths
  + Mafic Protoligh (basalt)
  + Green Schist/Green Stone is green becasue of chlorite
  + looks like a mica
  + forms with the micas, muscovite & friends
  + How to tell Chlorite from others Micas ?:
    * Micas are Elastic, Chlorite isn't. (+ color)
- Talc:
  + soft, greasy, fun to look at
  + Common in hydration of mafic to UltraMafic rocks
  + Hydration, Low-T metamorphism of ultramafic rocks
  + Water added to Basalt, but you need "Ultra"mafic protolith such as:
    * the mantle!
  + Inject water into the mantle and you'll make things like Talc
  + Or Serpentine!!
- Serpentine
  + Common in metamorphic hydration (add water to mantle, will make Talc, Brucite, Serpentine)
  + Is a fun one:)
  + _Very water rich_. It has an incredible solid storehouse of water. Up to 15% weight in water.
  + 3 Different Crystal forms Serpentine can take :important:
  + They're serpentine chemicallly and structurally.
  + Serpentine is a (T)(O) structure. But it can bend to fit things together. Bent Sheets (see page 1).
    * Lizardite: random ordering of bent TO's. Massive texture.
    * Antigorite: Ordered, wavy formation.
    * Crysotile: Ordered, in a circle. That's where we get the needles. Sheet Needle.
      - Asbestos form of Crysotile, and of Serpentine
      - It's not structurally a needle, it's a sheet.
      - not as bad as amphibole asbestos
** Clay Minerals
- XRD needed to identify the Clay Minerals
- sedementology - "clay" is anything finer than a grain size :question:
- mineralology - "clay" is a phylosilicate tends to be fine grained.
- Two Broad categories of Clay Minerals
*** 1:1 Clays
(T)(O) 
ex: Kaolinite
- strictly speaking, serpentine counts here. But it doesn't form in the same environment so we don't count it.
*** 2:1 Clays
(T)(O)(T)
ex: (*don't have their own formula, know that they're 2:1 clays, and that Smectite, Verm, and Montmor. form due to weathering of Mafic Rocks have a property of shrinking and swelling due to water uptake in the interlayer regions*)
- Smectite (includes some mix of Ca, Mg, Fe in the octahedral sites)
- Vermiculite
- Montmorillionite
- Illite (brings in K, similar to muscovite)
- *Kaolinite and Illite form from weathering of Felsic Rocks*
  + that's a big deal
- We could add Glauconite (K, Fe^{3+}) to the mix.
  - Often forms as a Clay in marine, sedimentary environments
  - sediment binds them
- *Smec, Verm, Montor. they expand and dessicate with water. By like 50%!!! That's huge*
- *Because they're so fine grained, you can't identify these potential dangers unless you resort to XRD*
END OF PHYLLOSILICATES
================================================================================
* Inosilicates
- Two types:
  + single chain silicates = pyroxenes. pyroxenes are single chain silicates. the end.
    * End in \ce{SiO3}
  + Dobule chiain silicates = amphiboles.
    * End in \ce{Si8O22}
** Pyroxenes
- LEARN THE STRUCTURE FIRST!!!, just like with the phyllosilicates
- And amphibole can get ugly formula-wise, so learn by structure first
- like feldspar with triangle, learn the triangle and use structure
*** Structure of Pyroxenes
- silicon tetrahedron's sitting flat on the board, stacked end to end. C-axis. Page 2.
- Along C-Axis view: \Delta\Delta\Delta
- how're we going to stack these chains?
- #1, Page 2:
  + Two inverted chains, glued with staggered cations.
  + glue: "M-1" site, 6-fold coordination, Mg^{2+}, Fe^{2+}
  + Looks kind of like I-Beam
- #2, page 2
  + stack base to base like heads with hats
  + "M-2" sites.
  + 6-8-fold coordinatoin.
  + Ca^{2+} or Na^{2+} or Fe, Mg
- General Formula for Pyroxenes: :question:
X  Y  Z_{2}        O_{6}
M2 M1  tetragonal
- The Pyroxene Crystals
  + stuby prisms
  + squarish cross-section (though there are exceptions)
  + <image> page 3
  + tends to have end 90 degree cleavage
  + striated along the C-axis
*** Pyroxene Compositions (Triangles)
- There are two classes
  + Orthorhombic Pyroxenes *need to know (OPX)* (orthopyroxene)
  + Monoclinic Pyroxenes  *need to know (CPX)* (clinopyroxene)
  + <image> big triangle on page 3
  + End Members:
    - Pure Calcium
    - Pure Magnesium
    - Pure Iron:
- On the Triangle
  + Wollastonite ("pyroxenoid"), not a pyroxene
  + :question: where are the CPX on the diagram...?
  + Diopside:
  + Hedenbergite
  + Augite: garden-variety pyroxene
  + Pure iron endmember is really rare
  + *(end members, enstatite, ferrosilite, Why not the \ce{Ca2} at the top?*)
  + Pigeonite:
    * At high temperatures, it's stable clinopyroxene.
    * As it cools, we hit exolution Gaps, solvus.
    * It will destabalize and unmix to become clino and orthopyroxenes, no longer perfect chain
  + Augite is a pyroxene, really general, kinda difficult to say much about
- *With these end member pairs, keep them together (Diopside, Hedenbergite)* :question: why?
- Enstatie and Ferrosillite are the only orthopyroxenes
- Chemically, we haven't covered Sodium (Na)
- So Na-Pyroxenes can't fit on 3 dimensions.p
  + Sodium goes in for Calcium in that M2 site. :question: how do we fit 4th dimension sodium on diagram?
  + 3 Important Na-Pyroxene End-Members:
    * Jadite: \ce{NaAlSi2O6} :question: what's the end member?
      - where Jade (semi-precious stone) comes from
      - forms in high to ultra-high pressure metamorphic rocks
      - Sodium is allowed into pyroxenes as pressure goes up
      - Formula similar to: Albite! :important:
	+ _silica undersaturated -> Jadite_
	+ _silica rich -> albite_
	+ Also favored by pressure
	+ _High Pressure -> Jadite_
	+ _Low Pressure -> albite_
    * Acmite: \ce{NaFe^{3+}Si2O6}
      - get in high-pressure metamorphic rocks
      - also in silica-undersaturated, sodium/alkali rich igneous rocks
	* (other minerals that form: feldspathoids (leucite, nepheline, brucite, sodalite ))
    * Omphacite: garbage pail pyroxene
      - presence of sodium and calcium that gives it its name
      - rich green, high-pressure metamorphism
      - green omphacite + red garnet (forms at high pressures (in subduction zones)) : Eclogite!
- (odd ones now) Spoodumene:
  + \ce{Li}-Pyroxene
  + \ce{LiAlSi2O6}
  + like lippidulite :question: spelling, relevance
  + another of our lithium ores
- Top of the triangle was pure calcium end-member
- Wollasanite is a pyroxanoid
  - perfect chains get bent and have a different unit cell
  - shorter length than a long chain
  - *Pyroxanoid's are Triclinic*!!! because of this bending

================================================================================
* <2016-03-01 Tue>

- In general, Na-Pyroxenes are indicators of ultra high pressure metamorphic conditions
- You need Calcium-rich metamorphic rocks (calc-silicates)
- Contact metamorphism of a carbonate country rock (calcite (calcium carbonate)), with magma will make a lot of diopside, hedenbergite
- Augite:
  + most common pyroxene
  + most common in mafic, igneous rocks
- Orthopyroxenes
  + Enstatite & Ferrosillite
  + not as common as the CPX's
  + Two Important Areas:
    + *Mantle rocks often have Orthopyroxene as their primary constituents*
    + *ultra-high Temperature Metamorphic rocks*
- Mantle is an interesting part of the earth.
- Pyroxenes are an important part of the mantle.
-
** Inosilicates : Amphiboles
- Double chains that end in \ce{Si8O22}
- <image> page 1
- A is 10-fold coordinated
- :questoin: importance of inosilicate pyroxene structure aside from learning formula
- Sites:
  + $W_{0-1}  X_{2} Y_{5} Z_{8} O_{22} (OH)_{2} $
- The W can be vacant.
- As crystals, Amphiboles get elongated prisms
- In cross-sections, they're 120 degree cleavage
- Amphiboles, of our common silicates, are the most complicated
- *You want to know all of this*
- Its a more common forming mineral in the crust than most pyroxenes.
- <image> Amphibole triangle
- :question: why are site's important to know for this exam?
- Minerals
  + Amphopholite: \ce{Mg2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2}
    * is an ortho-amphobole (orthorhombic)
    * enstatite was the pyroxene in the same place!
  + *Gedrite*/amphopholite :question: where gedrite
  + Cummingtonite: \ce{Fe2Mg5Si8}
    * still ortho-amphibole
  + *Grunerite* where is it?
  + Tremolite: \ce{Ca2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2}
    * the white amphibole (no iron)
    * then when its green it becomes...:
  + Ferro Actinolite: \ce{Ca2Fe5Si8O22(OH)2}
    * the iron makes it green
  + In general, any amphibole that lies along the solid solution line is garden variety
  + All of this is monoclinic
  + *Most Common Garden Variety Amphibole*: Hornblende \ce{Fe2Fe5Si8O22(OH)2}
    * the garbage pail amphobole, you can put anything in it
- Na-
*** Na-Amphiboles
- Two important *end-members*:
  + Na^{2} (M4)
  + Al     (M123)
  + :question: will we need to mix the m4, and m123 sites?
  + Glaucophane: \ce{Mg3Al2Si8O22(OH)2}
  + Riecheckite: \ce{Fe3^{2+}Fe2^{3+}}
    * blue asbestos
    * nasty stuff
    * asbestos forms as a consequence of iron-rich rocks
  + *spend time to recognize the similarities between the amphiboles and the pyroxenes*
  +
