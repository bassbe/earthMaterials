1.

2.

3. The sharing of edges or sides of coordination polyhedra generally
de-stabilizes a structure.
  -> large charged cations repel

*graph of number 3.* know your coordination polyhedra.

4. In structures with didfferently charged cations, hgih charged cations
usually do not share the same anion.^^xb

	-> anisocesmic - anisodesmic

5. Principle of Parsimony: Total number of different kinds of coustituent
sites in a mineral tends to be small.

ex: Biotite
12fold(K,Na)
6fold(Mg, Fe2, Fe3, Mn3, Al3+)3
4fold(Al3+, Si4+)O10 (OH)2

_Know Everything about the 8 most common cadioins._

Moving Towawrds Minteral Composition.

First: Isostructural Mierals
 	-> Same structure, different chemicals
ex: NaCl         PbS
    halite       galena
	-> Often, we name a mineral structure after a mineral that has that structure.
ex: NaCl structure
    CaF_2
    Poovskite


Second: Polymorph
	-> different structures, same chemistry
ex: Al_2 SiO_5
		-> aluminosilicate
			-> Kyanite
			-> andalusite
			->sillimanite
	-> Which polymorph develops depends on the pressure and temp of growth.



Mineral Composition:
We _Classify_ Minerals chemically on a basis of chemical anion or anion group
ex: silicate -> SiO_4 ^4-
    carbonate -> CO_3 ^2-
    phosphate -> PO_4 ^3-
    Sulfates  ->  SO_4 ^2-
    Sulfides  -> S^-2

beyone anion class, the rest of the chemistry is all about the cations.



How do we write the formula for a mineral?

Pure Substances
	-> Truly fixed chemical composition
ex:quartz -> SiO_2
   kaolinite -> -> Al_2Si_2O_5 (OH)_4

More often....

Solid Solution:
	-> Soution of defined chemical "end members" to form a homogenous mineral.

end member is a consitutant part. The red or the blue potion.

examples:
Olivine
	-> Silicate
	-> Structure ^VIM_2 ^IVSiO_4

end member
Fe_2SiO_4
fayallite
---->
other end member
Mg_2SiO_4
forsterite
=
Complete solid solution possible.


a "real" olivine in nature (Fe_(1,5)Mg_(0,5))SiO_4
				-> Fo25 (means 25% foresterite)


Waht controls the exact composition of the mineral?
	- composition of system (sometimes called X)
	- pressure and temperature (P and T)

Ex: Plagioclase feldspar
most abundant type of felspar
2 chemical end members

i        IV                          IV
Na^(+1)(AlSi_3)O_8 <--->  Ca^(+2)(Fl_2Si_2)O_8
Albite               Amorthite

This is a coupled subsititution

^IXNa^(+1) + ^IVSi^(+4) /---\ ^IXCa^(+2) + ^IVAl^(3+)
always account for site + charge

ex:

Biotite:

XII   VI         IV
K (Mg_1Fe)_3 (ALSi_3)O_10 (OH)_2

Mg is pilogopite, Fe is annite

how could we put Ba^(2+)
cooordinate site for cadions

take out
^XIIK^(1+) + ^IVSi^(4+)  = ^XIIBa^(2+) + ^(IV)Al^(3+)
or

^XIIK +  ^VIFe^(3+) = ^XIIBa^(2+) + ^VIMg^(2+)

or

2^XIIK^(1+)         = ^XIIBa^(2+) ^XII V (stands for Vacancy)


| Triclinic    | a!=b!=c | All angles not 90         |

| Tetragonal   |         |                           |
