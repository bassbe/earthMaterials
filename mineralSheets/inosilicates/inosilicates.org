# Tally system used to keep track of the items needed when constructing the
# mineral sheets. A checklist of sorts.

* Clinoamphiboles [100%]
** DONE Actinolite[5/5]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Distincitve Green Color
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Environment of Formation
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
** DONE Glaucophane[5/5]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Distinctive blue color in hand sample.
- Why we call high-pressure low-temperature rock "blueschist"
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Mineral Assmeblage
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
** DONE Hornblende[4/4]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Most common amphibole. Dark black to dark green.
- Usually used as garbage-can term for any amphibole.
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
** DONE [#B] Tremolite[5/5]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Pure Mg tremolite is white.
- Color is easiest way to diff from hornblende.
- Fibrous form is regulated as asbestos.
- Requires a Mg-rich environment to form (ex: a metamorphosed dolomite or serpentinite)
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Environment of Formation
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
* Clinopyroxenes [100%]
** DONE Diopsite & Augite[6/6]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Augite appears as black stubby prisms in hand sample
- Diopside-hedenbergite is greenish color and even emerald green when Cr is present
- 90 degree cleavage in hand samples
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Mineral Assemblage
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
*** DONE HL: Crystal System (not necessary for hand samples)
** DONE Omphacite[5/5]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Brilliant green pyroxene that forms in eclogite facies rocks.
- Mineral association with garnet or Kyanite can help separate from other pyroxenes
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Mineral Assemblage
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
* Orthopyroxenes [100%]
** DONE Enstatite[6/6]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Mineral Assemblage
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
*** DONE HL: Crystal System (not necessary for hand samples)
* Questions
- whats the difference between mineral assemblage and external shape or environment of formation?
