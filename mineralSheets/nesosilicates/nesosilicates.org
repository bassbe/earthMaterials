* Nesosilicates
** DONE Olivine[4/4]*
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Fracture
*** DONE HL: Mineral Associations
** DONE Garnet[4/4]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Hardness
** DONE Staurolite[5/5]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
- is an important index mineral for metamorphic rocks (more on thie later in the semester).
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE Twinning
*** DONE Environment of Formation
** DONE Andalusite[4/4]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
- Andalusite, kyanite, and sillimanite are polymorphs (i.e. have the same chemical formula) and are therefore very useful as metamorphic index minerals- since they crystalize at different temperatures and pressures (see Fig. 16.9 pg 347)
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: "x" in cross section
*** DONE HL: Evironment of Formation
** DONE Kyanite[3/3]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE Color
** DONE Sillimanite[2/2]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape (Small, Fiber-Like)
** DONE Zircon[4/4]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
- Zircon is an accessory mineral that is importnat for U-Pb geochronology. The zircon we see in lab today is highly unusual. Zircon is typically microscopic.
*** DONE HL: Tetragonal Form
*** DONE HL: Environment of Formation
*** DONE HL: Microscopic/Not Visible in Hang Sample
** DONE Titanite (Sphene)[4/4]
*** DONE Anotate Photos with Identification Description
*** DONE HL: Wedge-Saped Crystals
*** DONE HL: Tan Brown Color
*** DONE HL: High Luster
