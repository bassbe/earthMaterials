# Tally system used to keep track of the items needed when constructing the
# mineral sheets. A checklist of sorts.

* Phyllosilicates [100%]
** DONE Biotite [4/4]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Black mica; the most common sheet silicate.
- Black and vitreous in hand sample.
*** DONE HL: Xternal shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
** DONE Muscovite [4/4]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- White mica; present in all pelitic metamorphic rocks and s-type granites.
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
** DONE Chlorite [5/5]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- common sheet silicate
- found in low-grade pelitic and mafic metamorphic rocks
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Mineral Assemblage/Environment of Formation
*** DONE HL: Cleavage
** DONE Serpentine [4/4]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Often presents as wavy green almost amorphous looking aggregates. It has a range of drab olive green colors and a soapy look and feel. Common as hydration product of ultramafic minerals/rocks.
- Make sure to note the three pllymorphs.
*** DONE HL: Xternal Shape
*** DONE HL: Color
*** DONE HL: Mineral Assemblage/Environment of Formation
** DONE Talc [4/4]
*** DONE Annotate photos with identification description
- Soft, greasy look and feel.
- White, greenish or pale brown
- Often associated with hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks
*** DONE HL: Color
